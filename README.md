## Significant experience recommended if you want to take on this project, it isn't documented very well :)

Hardware required
- 3D printer
- 3x Nema 17 stepper motors, <=40mm long
- 1.5m gt2 belt
- 5x gt2 20t idlers with standoffs
- 3x gt2 20t drive pulleys
- mgn9 servo
- 600rpm micro gearbox motor
- 2x MGN9 linear profile bearings, 135mm len
- 1x MGN9 linear profile bearing, 95mm len
- 6x 6700 bearing
- Raspberry Pi
- (optional) Raspberry Pi Camera V1.4
- (optional) 3x 3mm white led
- Adafruit Feather
- Breadboard/pcb for laying out components
- Assorted M2 and M3 nuts and bolts

All part numbers in the pcb should be accurate, though again review and order at your own risk. Use KiCad to view/edit, it's free!

And probably a few other things I'm forgetting. Seriously if you want to make this, do so at your own risk. Review the cad model yourself and make sure you have everything accounted for! This is not a project for beginners!
